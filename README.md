Elections Ad Spending Analysis
This project analyzes the relationship between advertisement spending and voter turnout during elections. Using Python, data visualization tools, and statistical analysis, the project explores various aspects of election data, such as ad spending by state, voter turnout trends, and correlations between spending and turnout.

Overview
Political campaigns often allocate significant resources to advertisements to influence voter behavior. This analysis aims to examine whether there is a relationship between ad spending and voter turnout across different states and election phases.

Key Findings
Ad Spend by State:
A bar chart showed the total ad spend per state.

Voter Turnout by State:
Analyzed and visualized the average voter turnout for each state.

Correlation Between Ad Spend and Turnout:
The correlation coefficient was -0.010688, indicating no significant linear relationship between advertisement spending and voter turnout.
